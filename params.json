Build Once. Run on any device.](http://openui5.org)\r\n\r\nWhat is it?\r\n-----------\r\nOpenUI5 lets you build enterprise-ready web applications, responsive to all devices, running on almost\r\nany browser of your choice. Itâ€™s based on JavaScript, using jQuery as its foundation and follows web standards.\r\nIt eases your development with a client-side HTML5 rendering library including a rich set of controls\r\nand supports data binding to different data models (JSON, XML and OData).\r\n\r\nTry it!\r\n-------\r\nCheck out our [interactive control playground](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#content/Controls/index.html)\r\nas well as a number of [sample applications](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#demoapps.html).\r\n\r\nGet it!\r\n-------\r\nIt's free. Go to the [download page](http://openui5.org/download.html) and get the complete UI5 runtime\r\nand the UI5 SDK containing the documentation and many example apps as well as the complete runtime.\r\n\r\nYou can also consume [each OpenUI5 library](https://github.com/openui5?query=packaged-) individually via [bower](http://bower.io/), for example:\r\n```sh\r\nbower install openui5/packaged-sap.ui.core\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet started!\r\n------------\r\nTry the [Hello World](http://openui5.org/getstarted.html), read\r\nthe [Developer Guide](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/Documentation.html)\r\nand refer to the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html).\r\nCheck out the [SCN Forum](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/content) and\r\n[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sapui5) (use the tag \"sapui5\") to discuss code-related\r\nproblems and questions.\r\n\r\nHack it!\r\n--------\r\nYou can get the sources and build UI5 on your own, please check the [documentation for the UI5 development setup](docs/developing.md). You might then want to understand how [control libraries are structured and controls are developed](docs/controllibraries.md).\r\nMaybe there's a bug you could analyze and fix?\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
